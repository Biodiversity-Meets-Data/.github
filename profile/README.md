Github Space for Biodiveristy Meets Data (BMD) Project 

BMD will create a centralised digital platform, referred to as a Single Access Point (SAP), for managers of natural resources and policymakers to support biodiversity conservation across Europe. The SAP will combine high-throughput biodiversity monitoring tools with AI taxon identification services, enabling faster, more accurate and more frequent data collection over larger areas and longer timeframes. BMD will also provide tools and guidelines to mobilise historical baseline data and species checklists. Furthermore, BMD will develop a data catalogue with biotic and abiotic spatial data that allows linking species distribution data to environmental conditions and to identify the drivers of change. Users will be able to explore harmonised biodiversity data that is currently scattered, hard to find, or known only to experts. With online projection and analysis tools that are co-designed with the stakeholder communities, the SAP will help assess species conservation status, track biodiversity trends, and predict the impact of changes on land, in freshwater, and at sea—from local landscapes to European scale.
